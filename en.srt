Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...

11
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,124
to make people feel like crap.

12
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,741
I ditched work today.

13
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,241

If only I could meet
someone new.

34

I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished,

35
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,577
seeing that I'm incapable of making
eye contact with a woman [don't know.

36
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,875
Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi.

- I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.

00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,865
Okay if I sit closer?

51
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:17,364
- How far are you going?
- Uh, Rockville Center.

52
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,658
Get out! Me too.

53
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,450
- Really?
- What are the odds?

54
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,661
Do I know you?

55
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,499
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

56
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,749
- Sure. Hmm.
- That's it!

57
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,204
- [Joel] Yeah?
- I've seen you, man!

58
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,448
Book slave there for,
like, five years now.

59
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,036
- Ah.
- [woman] Jesus!

60
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,476
I would have thought
I would've remembered you.

61
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,992
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.

62
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,283
- What might?
- It changes a lot.

63
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,576
The color. That's why you might not
recognize me.

64
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,616
- It's called Blue Ruin.
- Right.

65
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,282
The color.

66
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,540
- Snappy name, huh?
- [Joel] I like it.

67
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,708
Yeah.

68
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:03,455
Anyway, this company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names.

69
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,580
Red... Red Menace, Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution.

70
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,957
That'd be a job,
coming up with those names.

71
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,787
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

72
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,165
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be?

73
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,454
- Fifty, maybe.
- Someone's got that job.

I came up with that one.

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,366
I'm gonna marry you.

178
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,741
I know it.
[slurps drink]

179
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,828
Um... okay.

[woman singing

181
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:19,497
Joel, you should come up to the Charles
with me sometime.

182
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,704
It gets frozen
this time of year.

183
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,582
- That sounds scary.
- Exactly.

184
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,574
I'll pack a picnic.

185
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,617
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.

186
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,456
And, um, we
could... Sounds good.

187
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,124
But I... I should, uh, go.
Now.

188
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,244
- You should stay.
- No, I really...

189
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:43,535
I'm... I...
I have to get up so early.

190
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,324
[Clementine]
I would like you to call me.

191
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,287
Would you do that?
I would like it.

192
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,823
Yes.

193
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,116
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,490
That'd be nice.

195
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,578

[Clementine on phone]
What took you so long?

198
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,082
I just walked in.

199
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,617
[Clementine]
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

200
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,324
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

201
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,207
- [Clementine] Oh!
- [laughs]

202
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,815
[Clementine] You said "I do." I guess
that means were married.

203
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,949
[laughs]
I guess so.

204
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,913
[Clementine] Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

205
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,324
- It's really solid this time of year.
- [cracking]

206
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,332

207

Oh. So beautiful.

00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,369
[Clementine] Isn't it?

212
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,323
[sighs]

213
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,347

- [Joel] Uh, don't go too far.

214
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,162
- Whoo! Ow! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!

215
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:27,705

- Ouch! Fuck it.

218
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,393
- I think I should go back.
- [Clementine] Come on.

219
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,577
- Huh?
- [Clementine] Come on!

220
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,374
What if it breaks?

221
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,249
"What if"? Do you really
care right now?

222
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,375
- Huh?
- [Clementine] Come here. Please.

223

- Slidey-slidey. Slidey-slidey.
- [Joel] Whoa! [chuckles]

227
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,000
- This is good.
- Here, let me show you this one thing.

228
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,619
[Joel] What are you doing?
Whoa.

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,365
[Clementine] Come on.

230
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,540
[Joel] Think I heard a crack.

231
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:14,285
[Clementine laughing]
It's not gonna crack or break or...

232
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,244
It's so thick.

233
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,704
Show me which
constellations you know.

234
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,536
Um. Oh.

235
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,783
I don't... know any.

236
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,699

Okay.

Oh. There's Osidius.

Where?

241
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,324
Right there. See?

242
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,288
It's sort of a swoop
and a cross.

[laughs]

245
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,617
- You're full of shit. Right?
- Nope.

246
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,705
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.

- Can I help you?
- What do you mean?

Can I help you with something?

I want it resolved.

I'm willing to be the one
to resolve it.

Why?

340
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,532
Why would she do that to me?

341
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,957
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

- For being honest.

man. You don't wanna go there.

00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,036
- Right.
- [Rob] Yeah.

349
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,994
I don't want to seem desperate.

350
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:11,957
Joel, why don't you just see this as
a sign, make a clean break. Right?

351
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,083
- Right?
- [Joel groans]

352
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,708
All right, Joel.
Look, man, seriously.

353
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,457
- [woman] Rob!
- Here's the deal.

354
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,458
Don't do that. Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

355
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,411
Well, what's your fucking
suggestion, Carrie?

356
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,290
What's your brilliant,
reasoned solution?

357
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,518
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

358
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:34,490
[Rob] I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult. Okay?

359
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,578
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

360
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,707
- What are you...
- [Carrie] That's your laundry!

361
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,905
- [Rob] That's great. That's good.
- [dog barks]

362
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:57,792
Okay.

363
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,559
- [shouts] What is it?
- [Rob] I don't know.

364
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,870
It's some place
that does a thing.

365
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,615
[beep]

366
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:22,953
[woman]
Good morning. Lacuna.

367
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:28,115
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the New Year.

368
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:32,746
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

369
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,665
How about on the fifth?

370
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,539
That's a Wednesday.

371
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,366
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

372
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,120
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

373
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,870
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

374
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:48,749
May I help you?

375
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:51,375
- I'm Joel Barish.
- [woman] Excuse me?

376
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:55,447
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr....

377
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,286
Mierzwiak.

378
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,788
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

379
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,309
[woman]
You still need to fill the form out, sir.

380
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,073
Really?

381
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,833
- Thank you.
- [mutters] Great.

382
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,116
- I don't have a pen.
- There's a pen right there.

383
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,283
[phone rings]

384
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,449
- Good morning. Lacuna.
- Oh.

385
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:17,118
[woman] Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done
now. That expired after the New Year.

386
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,615
Mr. Barish?

387
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,408
How are we today?

388
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,449
[Joel] Not too good, actually.

389
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,912
- [Stan] Boo!
- Oh, my God! Stan!

390
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,700
- Sorry. Sorry, I was just...
- I'm working!

391
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,742
[mutters]
Sorry. Sorry.

392
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,078
- [whispers] Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.

393
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,744
You should not have seen this.

394
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,282
I apologize.

395
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,370
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

396
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,533
- I assure you, no.
- [woman] No.

397
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,208
Mm-Mmm. There's no such thing as this.

398
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,246
[Mierzwiak] Look, our files
are confidential, Mr. Barish,

399
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,454
so I can't show you evidence.

400
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:11,367
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

401
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,249
and she wanted to move on.

402
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,417
[beep]

403
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,366
[Mierzwiak]
We provide that possibility.

404
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,684
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy..."

405
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,699
- [banging]
- "...and wanted to move on.

406
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,454
We provide
that possibility."

407
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,323
What the hell is that?

408
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:27,124
Nicest guy
she ever went out with.

409
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,956
[Rob]
Ow! Fuck!

410
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,199
[Carrie] God, Rob! Give it a rest!

411
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,831
It's okay.
It's all right.

412
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,458
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.

413
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:42,246
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.

414
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,369
She's impulsive.

415
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:47,705
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

416
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,456
[sighs]

417
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,499
A lark.

418
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:57,205
[sobbing] Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

419
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,538
I love you!
[sobbing continues]

420
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,324
[woman]
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

421
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,867
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

422
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:06,248
Okay. I want it done.

423
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,579
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

424
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,993
- Oh, Th-Th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

425
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:14,784
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
To come inside.

426
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,518
And, Mary, if you could
take care of Mrs. Woo.

427
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,499
- [Mary] Yes, of course.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.

428
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,408
Now, the, uh...

429
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:28,374
The first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

430
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,249
is to go home

431
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,499
and collect everything you own

432
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,329
that has some association
with Clementine.

433
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:37,578
Anything.

434
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:41,532
We 71 use these items

435
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:45,906
to create a map of Clementine
in your brain, okay?

436
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,165
So we 71 need, uh...

437
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,659
Uh, photos, clothing, gifts,

438
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,949
books she may have bought you,

439
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,617
CDs you may have
bought together,

440
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:58,407
journal entries.

441
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,949
We want to empty your home...

442
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,038
We want to empty your life
of Clementine.

443
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,199
And after the mapping is done,

444
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,242
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

445
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,614
That way, when you awake
in the morning,

446
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,250
you'll find yourself
in your own bed,

447
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:18,328
as if nothing had happened,

448
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,616
a new life awaiting you.

449
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:26,999
[driver]
Wake up, buddy!

450
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:34,408
[Mary]
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

451
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,541
You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.

452
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:42,121
Well, it's just not our policy here.
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

453
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:44,748
Hello. I'm right here.

454
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,362
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can...

455
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,074
We can fit you in
on the first of March.

456
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:53,041
Maybe you could
talk to the doctor, a-and he...

457
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,074
All right,
so let's make an appointment.

458
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,010
What day would you like
to come in this week?

459
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,451
- Mr. Barish.
- Um, he's really busy this afternoon.

460
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:05,489
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?

461
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:09,575
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

462
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,831
[chuckles]

463
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,615
[knocks]

464
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:16,124
[Dixieland jazz playing]

465
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:18,579
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

466
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,538
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

467
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,241
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

468
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,203
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

469
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:30,078
My name is Joel Barish,

470
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:34,164
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

471
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:39,365
Very good. Now, tell me about,
uh, Clementine.

472
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:41,499
Uh, I was...

473
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:46,413
living with this woman, Naomi,

474
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,291
uh, a couple years ago,

475
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:53,031
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach...

476
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,494
I don't like parties.

477
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,742
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...

478
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,909
and I, uh, met Clementine.

479
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,041
- [clattering]
- [man] I'm sorry.

480
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:07,246
Let's start with
your most recent memories

481
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:10,205
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

482
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,742
There's an emotional core
to each of our memories,

483
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,158
and when you eradicate
that core,

484
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,200
it starts its degradation process.

485
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,161
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

486
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:24,701
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

487
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,866
as in a dream upon waking.

488
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,250
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

489
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:33,330
[Mierzwiak]
Well, uh, technically speaking,

490
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,286
the procedure is brain damage,

491
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:38,576
but it's on a par
with a night of heavy drinking.

492
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,327
Nothing you'll miss.

493
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,411
[Stan] Comfortable?

494
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,116
What we're doing here,
Mr. Barish,

495
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:48,909
is actually creating
a map of your brain.

496
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,994
[Mierzwiak]
Okay, let's get started.

497
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,364
If we want to get this procedure under way
tonight, we have some work to do.

498
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:58,490
I want you to react to these objects,
Mr. Barish, if you will.

499
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,245
[Clementine whooping, laughing]

500
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,161
There's a good story
behind this one...

501
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,701
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get
a much better emotional readout

502
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:10,698
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

503
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,475
Just please try to focus
on the memories.

504
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,331
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

505
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,240
[typing]

506
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:20,990
[Stan] Healthy activity up there.
Healthy readouts. Very good.

507
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,075
- Here's another object.
- [Clementine] That's so...

508
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,117
[Stan] Next item. Okay.

509
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,949
Potato head.
[chuckles]

510
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:34,413
- Next item. Okay.
- [electricity crackling]

511
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:39,157
[distorted] Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.

512
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,726
[Stan] Hey, Patrick, do me a favor,
will ya?

513
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,750
[Patrick] Yeah.

514
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,995
[Stan] Can you, uh, check
the voltage regulator?

515
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:46,934
- [Patrick] Uh...
- [Stan] What do we got there?

516
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,995
- [Patrick] Voltage looks fine.
- [Stan] Really?

517
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,455
Well, I'm not wiping as clean
as I like here. I'm... [scoffs]

518
00:32:55,875 --> 00:33:00,494
[Mierzwiak] Well, uh, technically,
the procedure is brain damage.

519
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:05,204
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.

520
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,746
Oh, there you are. I...

521
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,993
Why am I... I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

522
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,829
Why am I standing here and...

523
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,244
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.

524
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:27,620
Déjà vu.
This is so...

525
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:30,512
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...

526
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,909
[both] ...under way tonight,
we have some work to do.

527
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,616
[whispering]
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

528
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:39,205
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.

529
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,867
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.

530
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,036
Very good.

531
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,083
[both] We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

532
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,993
That way you won't be confused later by
their unexplainable presence in your home.

533
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,532
[Stan]
Ah, there we go.

534
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,244
- Patrick?
- [Patrick] Yeah?

535
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,817
- [Stan, echoing] Patrick, can you check...
- [Joel] Patrick?

536
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,976
- [Stan] I'm getting some sort of...
- Patrick?

537
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,643
- [Stan] ...readout of my own voice.
- Patrick?

538
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,910
- Why are there so many wires?
- [Stan] A lot of equipment.

539
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,283
- Does that help?
- [Stan] Are you sure

540
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,119
you set that thing up properly?

541
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,684
- [Patrick] How's that?
- [Mary] How are you today, Mr. Barish?

542
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,601
- There we are, Mr. Barish.
- [Stan] All right. That's better.

543
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:17,697
- I don't know if I like this.
- [Patrick] Think I might try this then.

544
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,957
[Stan] We're almost done now.

545
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,366
Mmm. Journal.
That will be invaluable.

546
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,412
[Stan, distorted] "I met someone tonight.
I met someone tonight.

547
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,347
I don't know what to do. Her name
is Clementine, and she's amazing."

548
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,467
- [Joel screaming]
- [Stan] Whoa, whoa! Jesus!

549
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,328
- What? What?
- Come on! Careful!

550
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,956
- What? What?
- Step back!

551
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:37,328
Just take it easy.

552
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,911
- [beeps]
- [Patrick] That's fine.

553
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,950
- Let's not roach the guy.
- [sighs]

554
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,707
All right, we got that one.

555
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,912
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

556
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,403
[Stan] It's an apartment,
Patrick.

557
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,956
[whispers]
Patrick.

558
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,743
[Patrick] Well, not a dump then,
but sorta plain. Uninspired.

559
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,579
And there's sort of
a stale smell.

560
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:04,365
Patrick, can we just please
get through this?

561
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,782
- We got a very long night ahead of us.
- [Patrick] Yeah.

562
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:07,833
Come on.

563
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,573
[door unlocking, opening]

564
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,207
[Joel whispering]
This is the last time I saw you.

565
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,824
[Joel clears throat, sighs]

566
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,616
[Clementine sighs]

567
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,657
It's 3:00.

568
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:37,282
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.

569
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,369
[Joel sighs]
Were you driving drunk?

570
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:40,998
It's pathetic.

571
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:44,242
[Clementine] I was a little tipsy.

572
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,033
Don't call me pathetic.

573
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:49,041
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.

574
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,976
- Could've killed somebody.
- [Clementine] Oh, God.

575
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,518
I don't know. Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?

576
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,283
[Clementine] Oh, Christ!

577
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,768
[Joel] Should I check the grill to see
if there's children or small animals?

578
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,559
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.

579
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,101
God, you're like an old lady or something.

580
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:05,665
- What are you like? A wino?
- [Clementine] A wino?

581
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,621
[laughing] Jesus, are you from the '505
or something?

582
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,123
A wino?

583
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:12,953
Face it, Joely.

584
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:17,540
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you,

585
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,450
and in your little wormy brain,

586
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:24,414
you're trying to figure out,
did she fuck someone tonight?

587
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:27,783
No, see, Clem,

588
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,869
I assume you fucked
someone tonight.

589
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:32,999
Isn't that how you get people to like you?

590
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:46,410
[Joel sighs]
I'm sorry. Okay?

591
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:49,325
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?

592
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,283
- Clem?
- Your keys.

593
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,059
- [Joel] I was just...
- I won't need them anymore.

594
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,245
[Joel] I was just... [sighs]

595
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:03,125
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.

596
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,457
[door slams]

597
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:11,657
Clem?

598
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,573
- [computer beeps]
- [Stan] Got it.

599
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,744
Mary's coming over tonight.

600
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:20,282
- [Patrick] Yeah?
- Yeah.

601
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,914
Just thought you'd wanna know.

602
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,370
[Patrick] I like Mary. I like
when she comes to visit.

603
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,034
- I just don't think she likes me.
- She likes you okay.

604
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,780
So, maybe I should invite my girlfriend
over. I have a girlfriend now.

605
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,165
- Do whatever you want.
- Did I tell you I have...

606
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,869
- Hey, uh... [clicks tongue]
- Yeah.

607
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,116
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

608
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:45,659
We gotta focus here, Patrick.

609
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,449
[Patrick] Yeah, the thing is,

610
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,868
our situation is...
Is a little weird.

611
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:53,032
My girlfriend situation.

612
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:54,957
I'm sure it is.
[laughs]

613
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:56,875
You gotta be...

614
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,123
[engine starts]

615
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,994
Clem, let me drive you home.

616
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,329
Get out of my face, faggot!

617
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:32,121
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

618
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:34,283
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

619
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,957
You did it to me first!

620
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:40,413
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.

621
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,120
Clem! Can you hear me?

622
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,866
By morning you'll be gone!

623
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,743
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

624
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,268
[Patrick] Is there something wrong with
a girl being attracted to me?

625
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:01,614
- Is that a problem?
- [Stan] No, I think it's... funny.

626
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,659
[Patrick] So, who do you think's
better-looking, me or this guy?

627
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,915
[Stan]
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

628
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,245
[Patrick] Remember that girl
we did last week?

629
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,000
The one with the... potatoes?

630
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,243
[Stan] That girl?
Yeah, that... that's this guy's girl.

631
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,828
- [Patrick] Right.
- [Stan] Yeah.

632
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,617
[Stan chuckling]
Was. We took care of that.

633
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:24,282
Oh, come on!

634
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:28,031
Well, uh, I kinda
fell in love with her that night.

635
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:31,041
[laughing]
What? You little fuck...

636
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,121
- What?
- She was unconscious, man.

637
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,034
Well, she was beautiful, and...

638
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,158
I stole a pair
of her panties as well.

639
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,161
- Jesus!
- What?

640
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:47,745
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.

641
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,226
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

642
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,867
- [Patrick] They were clean!
- [Stan] What? D-Don't! Stop!

643
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:54,934
- [Patrick] Okay. Yeah! All right!
- [Stan] We got work to do.

644
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,369
- Okay. Fine.
- [computer beeps]

645
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:57,953
[Stan]
Give me my papers.

646
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:03,948
[crunching]

647
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,744
[slurps]

648
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,124
- [Patrick] There's, um...
- [sighs]

649
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,782
There's more.

650
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,953
After we did her, I kind of...

651
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:23,871
went to where she works
and asked her out.

652
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,573
[Stan]
You what?

653
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,242
- [mutters] Jesus.
- [Stan] Jesus, Patrick!

654
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,080
Do you have... any idea...

655
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,706
how unethical...

656
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:38,162
[laughing]
It's not really that bad.

657
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,951
What? What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

658
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:45,163
[Stan, echoing]
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!

659
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,494
[high-pitched giggling]

660
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,829
[laughing]

661
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,457
There's someone here.

662
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:01,532
He stole your underwear.

663
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,036
[distorted]
I don't see anyone.

664
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,412
[clock ticking]

665
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:24,357
- [indistinct chatter, laugh track on TV]
- [Clementine] Joel?

666
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:25,948
Where are my boots?

667
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:30,247
[man on TV] Why are you showing me
poisons? Can't you understand English?

668
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:33,159
"Potions," I said.
Potions.

669
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,579
[laugh track continues]

670
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,749
Love potion, please.

671
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:45,410
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

672
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:49,783
Should've left you
at the flea market.

673
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,078
[man on TV] First thing to do is

674
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,663
[chuckles] sift in a cup
of powdered whale heart.

675
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:04,998
Wanna go?

676
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,286
I want to have a baby.

677
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:11,291
[chuckles]
Let's talk about it later.

678
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:14,208
No! I want to have a baby.

679
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,323
I don't think we're ready.

680
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,115
You're not ready.

681
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,957
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

682
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,324
[scoffs]
What?

683
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:30,101
[mutters]
I don't wanna talk about it here.

684
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:33,163
I can't hear you. I can never the fuck
understand what you're saying.

685
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,573
- I don't wanna talk about this!
- Fucking ventriloquist!

686
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:38,184
- We're fucking gonna talk about it!
- I... don't... want... to...

687
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,976
You can't just say something like that
and say you don't wanna talk about it!

688
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,351
- [whispering] I'm sorry, Clem.
- I'd make a fucking good mother!

689
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,616
I love children,
I'm creative and smart,

690
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:48,659
- and I'd make a fucking great mother!
- Oh, God... Mmm!

691
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,871
[echoing] It's you, Joel. It's you
who can't commit to anything!

692
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:53,042
It's going! It's going!

693
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,518
You have no idea how lucky you
are I'm interested in you!

694
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:55,559
I don't even know why I am.

695
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:57,995
[fading] Maybe I should end this
right here, Joel!

696
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,518
- Leave you at the flea market...
- It's done.

697
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,954
- With stupid costume jewelry!
- This is crap.

698
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:04,726
Maybe you could find yourself
a nice antique rocking chair to die in!

699
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,590
- All the pain, confusion...
- [doorbell rings]

700
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,143
- Oh. Hi, Patrick.
- [Patrick] Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

701
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:18,158
- [Stan] Hey, you.
- Oh, it's freezing outside.

702
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,741
- [Stan] Find us okay?
- [Mary] Yeah.

703
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,540
- Mmm.
- Hot!

704
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:29,833
Poor guy.

705
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,245
Mmm? Oh.

706
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,911
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

707
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,871
Uh, we haven't really
checked yet.

708
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:39,157
- [Mary] Oh.
- Patrick?

709
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,495
- Uh, yeah.
- [Mary] Uh, let me do the honors.

710
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,415
[whispers]
Mary hates me.

711
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:47,908
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

712
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,491
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

713
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:53,455
- [typing]
- [Patrick whispering] Stan. Stan.

714
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,625
- There's more.
- No!

715
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,457
- Yes.
- No!

716
00:43:57,042 --> 00:44:00,364
- Hey, hey! [mock whispering]
- [Stan laughing]

717
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:02,658
Oh, you didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

718
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,871
- Uh, no, that's okay.
- [Mary] Wait.

719
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:10,247
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
the better even of their blunders."

720
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,162
[laughing]
Oh.

721
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,869
- Oh!
- [Stan] Oh!

722
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:19,114
- [Patrick laughing]
. [Stan] Mmm!

723
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,581
[Mary groans]

724
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,663
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.

725
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,949
I found it in my Bartlett's.

726
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,490
What's your Bartlett's?

727
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:33,031
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.

728
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:35,575
I think Howard will be
in Bartlett's one day.

729
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,491
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

730
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:39,999
- [crashing]
- [Mary laughs] God!

731
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,579
- [Patrick laughing]
. Can you wake him up?

732
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,458
[Patrick laughing]
You can't wake him up.

733
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:46,625
[Stan yells]

734
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:49,157
[Joel] Mmm.

735
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,498
[moans]

736
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:55,453
You don't tell me things, Joel.

737
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,540
I'm an open book.

738
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,786
I tell you everything.

739
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,791
Every damn embarrassing thing.

740
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,240
You don't trust me.

741
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,114
Constantly talking isn't
necessarily communicating.

742
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,407
I don't do that.

743
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:23,249
I want to know you.

744
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,157
Hmm?

745
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,621
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!

746
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:33,749
People have to
share things, Joel.

747
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:35,407
Mm-hmm.

748
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,620
That's what intimacy is.

749
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:40,658
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

750
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,540
I'm sorry.

751
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:45,325
It just... really just
isn't that interesting.

752
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:50,351
[Clementine] I wanna read some of those
journals you're constantly scribbling in.

753
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:54,790
What do you write in there if you don't
have any thoughts or passions or... love?

754
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:06,202
[Joel]
November 19, 2003.

755
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,412
Dinner at Kang's again.

756
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,117
Are we like
those poor couples...

757
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,287
you feel sorry for
in restaurants?

758
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,703
Are we the dining dead?

759
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:24,198
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

760
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:30,453
[whispers]
I like that.

761
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:34,792
How's the chicken?

762
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:37,123
Good.

763
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:41,204
- More?
- No. No. Thank you.

764
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,162
[Joel] She's gonna be drunk
and stupid now.

765
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,324
Hey, would you do me a favor

766
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,300
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

767
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,661
- Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
- It's really...

768
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,119
- Gross.
- Gross.

769
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,074
- It's just...
- Repulsive.

770
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,740
It's repulsive.

771
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,663
[phone beeping]

772
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:11,237
- [line ringing]
- [Stan] Patrick, can we get through this?

773
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,661
Patrick.

774
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:14,373
[Patrick]
Hey, Tangerine.

775
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,366
[Clementine on phone]
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

776
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:20,534
[sighs]
I'm so miserable right now.

777
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:23,434
- [Patrick] Why? What's wrong?
- [Clementine] I don't know.

778
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:26,018
- [distorted] Excuse me?
- [Clementine on phone] I'm so confused!

779
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:27,893
[distorted] Can I help you
find something, sir?

780
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:30,875
[Patrick] Confused? What are you
confused about? Everything's fine.

781
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,619
[Patrick distorted]
Baby, come here.

782
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,078
[Patrick]
Scared of what?

783
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,744
[Clementine on phone] [don't know.

784
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,413
- Do you love me?
- [Patrick] Of course I do.

785
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:44,369
[whispers]
Where's the self-help section?

786
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:46,783
[Clementine sobbing]
Do you think I'm ugly?

787
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:49,165
- [Patrick] No! You're beautiful!
- [dishes rattle]

788
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,620
- Maybe [should come over.
- [Clementine] No, no.

789
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:55,786
I don't know. I-I'm a mess, Patrick.
You know.

790
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,101
[Patrick] Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

791
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,490
[Clementine]
Okay.

792
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,785
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

793
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:05,950
Patrick, we're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

794
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,958
[muffled] Let him go, Stan!
Let him go. I'll help.

795
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:12,093
- [Patrick] See?
- [Mary] How hard can it be?

796
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,867
- She hates me. She wants me to go.
- Go.

797
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:18,534
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

798
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:20,407
You like?

799
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:23,701
[laughing]
Oh, man!

800
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:25,536
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

801
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,449
- I like it.
- You do?

802
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,912
- You look like a tangerine.
- Oh!

803
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:33,405
- "Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
- [Joel] Mmm! Juicy!

804
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:36,166
- And seedless.
- I like that.

805
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,666
I like tangerines!

806
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,120
- Can you see me doing ducks?
- Tangerine.

807
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:45,329
[Clementine] Joel. Ducks.
[quacking]

808
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,220
- How does he know to call you that?
- [Clementine] How did who know?

809
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,909
- Oh, my God. Clem?
- [Mary] This is pretty cool.

810
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,494
That's what
they called themselves.

811
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:55,125
The Clash,
the only band that mattered.

812
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:57,078
They called themselves that
for a reason.

813
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,786
It's amazing, isn't it?

814
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:01,165
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

815
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,495
What Howard gives to the world.

816
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:06,953
- Yeah.
- [beeping]

817
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:09,116
To let people begin again.

818
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,828
[punches keys]

819
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,832
It's beautiful.

820
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,074
You look at a baby, and it's so pure
and so free and so clean.

821
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,368
And adults are, like,
this mess of sadness

822
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,375
and... phobias.

823
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:27,374
Howard just makes it
all go away.

824
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:39,249
[Patrick] Oh, my God.

825
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,493
- Baby, what's going on?
- I don't know. I don't know!

826
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:48,331
I'm lost. I'm scared.
I feel like I'm disappearing.

827
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,117
- [Patrick] Disappearing?
- My skin's coming off! I'm getting old!

828
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:53,972
- Nothing makes any sense to me!
- [Patrick] You're not getting old.

829
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,617
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.

830
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:59,580
- Oh, Tangerine.
- Nothing makes any sense.

831
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:04,035
- Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
- It's okay. It's okay.

832
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:08,115
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

833
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,911
- Montauk?
- Yeah.

834
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,949
No! Come up
to Boston with me.

835
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:13,957
Sure. Yeah.
We can go next weekend.

836
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:17,447
No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

837
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:19,616
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

838
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:23,740
- [rock music playing]
- [Mary giggling]

839
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:25,658
[answering machine]
Hi, it's Joel.

840
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:31,158
Um, leave a message after the beep,
and I'll get back to you.

841
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:32,949
[beeps]

842
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:35,412
[Patrick on answering machine]
Pick up! Pick up, man!

843
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:39,030
[Stan] W-W-Whoa. Hold on,
hold on, hold on. [laughing]

844
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:43,287
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

845
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,075
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

846
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,742
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.

847
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,574
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.

848
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,787
He's pretty much on autopilot
right now anyway.

849
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,476
[Patrick on phone] Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.

850
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,036
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

851
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,865
[muttering]
Charles.

852
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:05,998
Come on. Charles.

853
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:13,204
"Look! You and me,
on the Charles River!

854
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:18,202
I could die right now, Clem. I'm just
happy. I've never felt that before.

855
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,116
I'm just exactly where I want..."

856
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:24,534
- I'm so excited. Yay.
- I'm excited too.

857
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:28,496
- Cool.
- Oh, uh, I, uh...

858
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,786
I got you this...

859
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,950
- [Clementine] What?
- Thing, um...

860
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:36,162
Happy early Valentine's Day.

861
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:37,744
Oh!

862
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,491
Wow. What is it?

863
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:44,125
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.

864
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,828
[Clementine] Oh.

865
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,411
It... It's gorgeous!

866
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:56,575
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

867
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,790
God, I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

868
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:02,907
Thank you.

869
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,956
- Let's go.
- Okay.

870
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:15,117
- [Clementine] Joely?
- [Joel] Yeah, Tangerine?

871
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,453
[Clementine] Am I ugly?

872
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,619
- Mm-Mmm.
- [Clementine] When I was a kid,

873
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:23,032
I thought I was.

874
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:27,202
[sighs] Can't believe
I'm crying already.

875
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:30,204
Sometimes I think people
don't understand

876
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:32,833
how lonely it is to be a kid.

877
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:36,034
Like you don't matter.

878
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:39,326
So, I'm eight,

879
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:41,790
and I have these toys,

880
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,957
these dolls.

881
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:48,369
My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

882
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,661
And I keep yelling at her:

883
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:54,080
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

884
00:52:55,417 --> 00:52:56,452
It's weird.

885
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:59,750
[Like if] can transform her...
[sniffles]

886
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:02,829
I would magically change too.

887
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:09,203
[Joel whispers] You're pretty.

888
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:12,993
Joely, don't ever leave me.

889
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:17,206
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

890
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:20,822
[Joel] Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

891
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,490
Just this one.

892
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:25,167
[Clementine] I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.

893
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,289
- Whoo!
- [Joel] Whoa!

894
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,270
- [Clementine whoops]
- [Joel] Stop it!

895
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,661
[Clementine laughing]

896
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:35,074
[Joel] I could die right now, Clem.

897
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:39,164
I'm just...

898
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:42,203
happy-

899
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,290
I've never felt that before.

900
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,533
Mmm.

901
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,540
I'm just exactly...

902
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,824
where I wanna be.

903
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,167
Clem?

904
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,164
I want to call it off.

905
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,286
I'll give you a sign.

906
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,244
I want to call it off.

907
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:22,120
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!

908
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,203
[echoing] I want to call it off!

909
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:28,951
[man] ♪ When you ain't
got nothing to do ♪

910
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,786
♪ I think I'll marry you ♪

911
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:33,958
Is anybody there?

912
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:39,249
[groaning]

913
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,708
- Clementine!
- [Clementine] Joel?

914
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:46,082
- Clement...
- [Clementine] Joely!

915
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,832
- Clem!
- [Clementine] Joel!

916
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,035
Clem.

917
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:51,825
- Clem!
- What?

918
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,991
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- What? Where?

919
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,625
- I have an idea of how to stop this.
- Stop what?

920
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:00,124
- Joely.
- Come on.

921
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,226
- [Joel] No!
- [Clementine] Smell my pits!

922
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,457
[Joel] No! No! No!
Don't tickle me!

923
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,934
- [Joel speaking indistinctly]
- [Clementine] Smell my pits.

924
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:09,120
No. Come on.
Concentrate, Clem.

925
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,242
- We gotta get back to the office.
- [Clementine] Halloween.

926
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:15,704
[Joel] There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.

927
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:17,536
Not the picture.

928
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:21,076
Where is it?
Back here. Come on!

929
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,833
[Clementine] Oh, look at me.
Hey, [look good there.

930
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,072
[Mierzwiak] Look, our files
are confidential, Mr. Barish,

931
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,161
so I can't show you evidence.

932
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:32,996
Suffice it to say that
Miss, uh... Miss Kruczynski

933
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:36,489
was not happy
and she wanted to move on.

934
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:40,143
- Good, now, tell me about Clementine.
- [Joel] Just tell me

935
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:41,578
everything you remember.

936
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,518
- That's what he said. Then...
- [Clementine] What did we see that day?

937
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,453
- [Joel] No, wait.
- [Clementine] Oh, look! Hey!

938
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,707
- [Joel] Shit!
- We're going to see my grandma.

939
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,268
- Joel, what? No, I don't want to...
- [Joel] We're not going on a train.

940
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:53,184
[Clementine] Joel, please!
Don't make me run anymore.

941
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,448
[Joel] Come on!

942
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:56,532
Mierzwiak!

943
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:59,527
- [Clementine] Do we always have to run?
- [Joel] Mierzwiak!

944
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:05,250
[dog barking]

945
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:10,998
Please.

946
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:14,705
So, why don't we begin
by you telling me

947
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,912
everything you can remember.

948
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,450
[Joel]
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

949
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:22,663
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

950
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:25,700
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

951
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,833
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

952
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,786
You're erasing me from her...

953
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:35,498
I don't know.

954
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:39,996
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

955
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:42,124
I'm in my brain.

956
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:45,034
I'm part of your
imagination too, Joel.

957
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,825
How can I help you from there?

958
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,823
- Uh, I'm inside your head too. I'm you.
- [clattering]

959
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,958
[grunts]
Sorry.

960
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:57,082
Look. Who's that?

961
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,241
Oh, he-he works for us.

962
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:06,620
That's, uh,
Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy.

963
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:08,157
He's stealing my identity.

964
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:10,664
He stole my stuff.

965
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,538
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

966
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:19,121
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

967
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,782
He stole her underwear.

968
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:24,121
- [door closes]
- I could die right now, Clem.

969
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,823
I'm just happy.

970
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:30,872
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.

971
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:33,993
I want to go home.

972
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:37,828
Hey. What?

973
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,450
Clem!
[grunting]

974
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:45,328
Wait. Clem!

975
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:48,990
Clem?

976
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:51,874
- They're erasing you.
- [dog barks]

977
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:53,999
- [Clementine] I'm here!
- [screams]

978
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:57,159
- Clem, focus. I hired them, okay?
- [Clementine laughing]

979
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,698
I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid.

980
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,913
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

981
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:05,041
I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.

982
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,697
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

983
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:14,288
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

984
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,581
Wake yourself up!

985
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,082
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

986
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,059
Okay, here we go.
Will this make you happy if I try?

987
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,083
[Clementine] Yeah.

988
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,958
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

989
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,287
Yeah. Okay.

990
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:30,658
Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.

991
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:33,351
- [Mary laughs] Don't! That tickles me!
- [Stan] Oh, my goodness.

992
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:36,288
Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the...

993
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:37,789
[Mary]
It's a birthmark!

994
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,991
It did work, for a second,

995
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,934
- but I couldn't...
- [Clementine] See?

996
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:46,958
I couldn't move.

997
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:51,657
Oh, well, isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

998
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:54,073
It's more important to prove me wrong
than to actually...

999
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:56,208
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

1000
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,619
Fine.

1001
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:03,913
Then what? I'm listening.

1002
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,324
I don't know.
You erased me.

1003
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,100
That's why I'm here. That's why
I'm doing this in the first place.

1004
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:10,661
I'm sorry.
You... You!

1005
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:12,494
You know me.
I'm impulsive.

1006
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,039
[sighs]

1007
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:18,908
That's what I love about you.

1008
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,657
- [beeping]
- [Clementine] Joel?

1009
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:26,268
- [Joel] Mm-hmm?
- [Clementine] I have another idea

1010
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:27,327
for this problem.

1011
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,411
This is a memory of me,

1012
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:34,537
the way you wanted to have sex on the
couch after you looked down at my crotch.

1013
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,541
- What?
- Joel, the eraser guys are coming here,

1014
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:40,666
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

1015
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:44,201
somewhere where I don't belong,
and we hide there till morning?

1016
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:53,280
[sighs] Oh, man. I can't remember
anything without you.

1017
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:56,576
[scoffs] Tsk, that's very sweet,
but try, okay?

1018
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,785
Okay.

[Clementine] Joel?

1032
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:53,292
Joel?

1033
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,328
Where'd you go?

1034
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:58,953
I'm supposed to come too!

1035
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:00,601
[woman] Listen,
I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.

1036
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:02,726
Can you stir the soup and
can you keep an eye on Joel?

1037
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,601
- [woman #2] Sure.
- [woman] He just likes to be near me.

1038
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,582
- Absolutely!
- Clem?

1039
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,823
It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!

1040
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,119
It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!

1041
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:18,159
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

1042
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:21,667
Who am I?

1043
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:24,079
- [Joel] Mrs. Hamlyn.
- Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

1044
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,833
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

1045
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,163
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

1046
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:32,293
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

1047
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,572
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

1048
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,430
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?

1049
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:39,539
No, not at all.

1050
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:41,699
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.

1051
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:45,285
- [woman] Thank you so much.
- [Joel] She's not looking at me.

1052
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:48,450
- She's busy. She's not looking at me.
- [laughing]

1053
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,822
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

1054
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,992
[Clementine] Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!

1055
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:56,768
[woman] Is every little peanut
under there okay?

1056
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:58,157
[Clementine] Mm-hmm! He's fine.

1057
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,973
You know, do you have something to drink?

1058
01:02:00,042 --> 01:02:02,518
[woman] Would you drink a cocktail at
this hour? I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

1059
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:04,351
- [Clementine] I would die for a vodka.
- [woman] Oh! Hang on.

1060
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,495
Let me check if I have that.

1061
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:08,101
[Clementine] Okay! I'm just gonna wait
right here. Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

1062
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,036
- [grunting]
- [Clementine] Uh, Joely.

1063
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:11,994
Your mother wants me to mind you.

1064
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:13,828
- Get back under the table.
- Ice cream.

1065
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,162
- Ice cream.
- [Clementine] No, not until after,

1066
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,698
you know, you've had your dinner.

1067
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,635
- [angry grunt]
- [Clementine] Come on, Joel!

1068
01:02:21,042 --> 01:02:22,328
Joel, grow up!

1069
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,707
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem. [sobbing]

1070
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,866
- This is sort of warped.
- [Joel] I'm scared.

1071
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:30,535
- [crying] I want my mommy!
- Don't cry, baby Joel.

1072
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:34,997
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

1073
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:37,851
Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!

1074
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:39,866
Hey, honey, look.

1075
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:42,125
Wait there.

1076
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,322
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

1077
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,740
Yuck.

1078
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,411
[buzzing]

1079
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:56,242
- [buzzing]
- It stopped.

1080
01:02:57,042 --> 01:02:58,532
What?

1081
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,665
It stopped erasing.

1082
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,995
Oh, shit.

1083
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,990
This is terrible.

1084
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,332
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

1085
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,990
- [Mary] Where?
- I don't know where!

1086
01:03:11,167 --> 01:03:12,828
What do you mean? I don't know where!

1087
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:16,910
This is bad. This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

1088
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:19,665
Okay. Crap.

1089
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:22,575
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

1090
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:24,476
- What should we do?
- [Stan] I don't know what to do.

1091
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,500
I don't know what to do.

1092
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,578
- What should we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

1093
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,750
I just said that!

1094
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:30,351
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What should we do?

1095
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:33,788
I don't know. Now, look,
you're freaking me out. Mellow out.

1096
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:37,781
Well, we have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

1097
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:40,798
- Quiet. You're freaking me out. Shh. Shh.
- [Mary] All gooey and... and

1098
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:42,457
- half-baked.
- [Stan] Okay.

1099
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:44,115
Hmm, that sounds so good.

1100
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:45,782
- [Stan] Oh, shit!
- I'm hungry.

1101
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,824
- Oh, shit!
- [Mary] Oh! Oh!

1102
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,367
What? Oh!
What, what? What?

1103
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:53,455
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

1104
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,662
This is my... I can handle this.

1105
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,870
- I can't call Howard.
- He's an unbaked cookie.

1106
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,784
He's... There's no time
to fuck around.

1107
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:03,199
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?

1108
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:06,163
- [Mary] Stop fucking around!
- Okay, I'll call Howard.

1109
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,697
- [phone rings]
- [Mierzwiak] Mmm.

1110
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,992
[phone rings]

1111
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:15,684
- Hello.
- [Stan on phone] Hello, Howard?

1112
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:16,948
Hey, it's Stan.

1113
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:21,289
Um, I'm working on this guy down here,
and we seem to have lost him for a moment,

1114
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:24,120
and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.

1115
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:27,614
Okay, uh, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

1116
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:31,114
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was
away from the monitor for a minute

1117
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:33,704
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh...

1118
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,375
I had to pee.

1119
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:39,497
- [Mierzwiak] Where's Patrick?
- Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick.

1120
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,624
[Mierzwiak] Ah, geez.

1121
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:44,742
- Okay, what's the address?
- [Stan] I know. I'm so sorry.

1122
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:47,750
- [Mierzwiak] That's okay. Come on.
- [Stan] I'm at 159 South Village.

1123
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:51,364
- [Mierzwiak] Yeah.
- [Stan] Apartment 1E. Rockville Center.

1124
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:52,623
- Mary?
- [Mary] Yeah?

1125
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,157
He's coming right now.

1126
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,165
- [Mary] I'm staying.
- [bottles clinking]

1127
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,620
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- [Mary] I'm staying.

1128
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:01,033
- I think you should go.
- Hell, no.

1129
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:04,781
Mary. Shit.

1130
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:08,622
- I am so stoned.
- [Stan] Please, Mary.

1131
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:11,324
- You have to go.
- [Mary] Stop being stoned, Mary.

1132
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,411
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

1133
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:18,406
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble
we're gonna get into if Howard comes...

1134
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:21,575
[Clementine] Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!

1135
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:23,915
[blubbering]

1136
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:29,704
- Joel!
- I want her to pick me up.

1137
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:33,197
- It's weird how strong that desire is.
- Joel! Joel, look at me! Look.

1138
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,741
You'll remember me
in the morning,

1139
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:38,797
and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me
about us, and we'll start over.

1140
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:41,284
[woman] Pat? I just... Pat?

1141
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:43,495
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

1142
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:45,954
That Patrick guy,
he's copying me.

1143
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:47,998
What Patrick guy?

1144
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:49,828
- That guy!
- What?

1145
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,832
He's here in my apartment.

1146
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,616
He's one of those eraser guys.

1147
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:55,226
He fell for you
when they were doing you,

1148
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,163
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

1149
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,574
and you guys are dating.

1150
01:06:01,042 --> 01:06:03,909
Really? Is he cute?

1151
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:08,825
Clem, there's nothing
wrong with you.

1152
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,332
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

1153
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,413
You... You're kind.

1154
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,073
- [sobbing]
- You're beautiful...

1155
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:18,619
and smart and funny...

1156
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:21,165
and... nice.

1157
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,456
What?

1158
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,119
[Stan] Okay. All right.

1159
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:31,120
[Marv] Okay. on!

1160
01:06:31,292 --> 01:06:33,954
- Move, move, move! Come on. Let's go.
- [Stan] Careful, careful.

1161
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:35,331
[Stan] Fine.

1162
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,037
- [groans]
- Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1163
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:41,283
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

1164
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:43,620
- [chuckles]
- [doorbell rings]

1165
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:45,078
[Mary clears throat]

1166
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:47,782
Be cool. Cool.

1167
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,934
- Hello, Mary. What are you doing here?
- [Stan] Oh, hi, Howard.

1168
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:56,369
She was just here to help out.

1169
01:06:56,542 --> 01:07:00,206
I wanted to understand as much as
I could about the procedure as possible.

1170
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:03,743
I think it's important for my job to
understand the inner workings

1171
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,578
of the work that we do.

1172
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:08,412
Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...

1173
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,663
by people... where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

1174
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,624
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,

1175
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:17,658
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

1176
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:19,828
Uh, yeah. Um...

1177
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,708
- Well, that's odd.
- I already tried that.

1178
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,143
[Mierzwiak] Did you try going through
the C-gate?

1179
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:28,657
[Stan] Yeah, of course.

1180
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,199
I mean... yes.

1181
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:33,532
Yeah.

1182
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:35,624
[clears throat]

1183
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,206
All right.

1184
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,268
- [Stan] You want to get linked up?
- Yeah.

1185
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:42,292
All right.

1186
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:46,245
I already-4 ran
the utility programs,

1187
01:07:46,417 --> 01:07:48,454
and I had nothing there,

1188
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:51,333
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1189
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:53,684
- [Mary] Here, Howard.
- [Stan] Okay.

1190
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:55,143
- I got you a chair.
- [Mierzwiak] Oh, thanks.

1191
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:55,998
There you go.

1192
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:58,704
You're welcome. Whew!

1193
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:02,197
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory,

1194
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,366
see if something comes up.

1195
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:07,745
[woman] ♪ Oh, my darling,
oh, my darling ♪

1196
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,659
♪ Oh, my darling Clementine ♪

1197
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:13,719
- ♪ You are lost and gone forever ♪
- I love being bathed in the sink.

1198
01:08:13,792 --> 01:08:16,232
- ♪ Dreadful sorry, Clementine ♪
- Such a feeling of security.

1199
01:08:16,417 --> 01:08:18,078
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.

1200
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,490
[giggling] Hmm!

1201
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:20,953
[Mierzwiak] There it is.

1202
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:24,910
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1203
01:08:26,417 --> 01:08:27,977
[Stan] What the heck
was he doing there?

1204
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,706
[grunts]

1205
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:33,203
[gagging]

1206
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,161
[coughing]

1207
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:38,742
[Mierzwiak] His eyes are open.

1208
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:43,745
- Has this happened before with him?
- [Stan] No.

1209
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:48,535
Oh, this is...
This is not good. No.

1210
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,869
I'm gonna have to...

1211
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,744
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1212
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,993
[gasps, panting]

1213
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:19,954
Can't you see?
[love you, Antoine.

1214
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:23,290
[Mierzwiak]
Okay, we're back in.

1215
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:26,450
[Mary] Wow. That was beautiful
to watch, Howard.

1216
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:29,788
Like a surgeon or
a concert pianist or something.

1217
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,244
Thank you, Mary.

1218
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:37,740
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

1219
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:42,286
Why can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1220
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:44,532
Hmm. Lucky me.

1221
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:48,781
Lay one on me.
[kissing]

1222
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:52,157
Don't call me Antoine.

1223
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,745
- My name is Wally.
- [Clementine] Yes, I know,

1224
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:57,204
but how can a woman love
a man with a name like Wally?

1225
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,332
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1226
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,434
- Hey.
- [Joel] My God, there's people

1227
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:02,458
coming out of your butt.

1228
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,912
[Clementine] There is?
[giggling]

1229
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,790
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

1230
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:11,791
- What, Joel... What are you doing?
- We gotta go.

1231
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,370
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!

1232
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,116
You can run, but you can't hide.

1233
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:20,948
Clem, come on!

1234
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,991
- There I am.
- [tires screech]

1235
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:26,125
That truck.

1236
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:29,205
Doc? Please.

1237
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:33,198
[Mierzwiak, distorted] All right,
let's begin by you telling me

1238
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:35,207
everything you remember...

1239
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,371
That's strange. He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1240
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:44,156
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

1241
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,415
[sighs]
Come on, Clem.

1242
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,559
[Stan] He seems to have developed some
sort of resistance to the procedure.

1243
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:51,780
- I don't want to run anymore.
- Shit.

1244
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,250
Come on, come on.

1245
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,533
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1246
01:10:57,708 --> 01:11:00,200
- Where?
- Hide me in your humiliation.

1247
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:04,159
- [Joel] Humiliation.
- [boy] Come on, you big baby!

1248
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,994
' [Joel] I'm sorry, okay?

1249
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:09,660
[angry voices overlapping]

1250
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:12,370
- [Joel] Let me drive you home.
- [child yells]

1251
01:11:13,042 --> 01:11:14,248
[Clementine] Joel!

1252
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:17,495
- [Mary] Bye, Howard.
- No, wait. Howard.

1253
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,912
He's disappeared again.

1254
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:25,202
- Oh, dear.
- [Mary] I'm so sorry, Howard.

1255
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:27,073
[Joel] Humiliation.

1256
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,448
Humiliation.

1257
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,915
- Humili...
- Joel

1258
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:35,370
[sighs]
I don't like it either.

1259
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:37,582
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to...

1260
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:40,663
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just... Oh, um...

1261
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,708
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

1262
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,915
- [wheezing laugh]
- [woman] Good night, sweetheart.

1263
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,995
[laughing continues]
No.

1264
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:50,578
I'm sorry, Joel.

1265
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,115
- [Joel] Shut up.
- Joely.

1266
01:11:53,292 --> 01:11:55,704
Look! Joel!

1267
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,073
- Joel, look!
- What?

1268
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,082
Look where we are!

1269
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,740
- Whoo!
- Oh, no.

1270
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,287
Clem, this isn't good.

1271
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:09,031
Then hide me somewhere...
Somewhere really buried.

1272
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:11,916
[children shouting]

1273
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:14,541
- Hit it! Hit it!
- [Joel] I can't! I gotta go home.

1274
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:16,540
I'll do it later!

1275
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,200
[shouting continues]

1276
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:23,618
[boy] Come on, you big sissy!
Hurry up! Hit it!

1277
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:31,283
[sobbing]

1278
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:34,249
[children]
Ooh!

1279
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:37,620
[boy] Ooh, he has a girlfriend!

1280
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:40,159
Wait. What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?

1281
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:42,370
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow! Ow!

1282
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,536
- [groaning]
- Joel!

1283
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:45,833
Joely, get up.

1284
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,684
- Come on. It's not worth it.
- Hit him! Hit him!

1285
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:51,952
They're not worth it, Joel!
La-Ia-Ia-Ia-Ia! He's not listening!

1286
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:54,036
- Come on, Joel.
- Stupid!

1287
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,614
- [Joel] I'm so ashamed.
- [Clementine] It's okay.

1288
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:06,499
- You were a little kid.
- [Joel] Yeah.

1289
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:09,159
- [Clementine] Come on.
- [Joel] That's where I live... lived.

1290
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:11,324
I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.

1291
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,662
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.

1292
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,289
You can really kill me this time.

1293
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:16,518
- It's my turn. Go.
- [Joel] I can?

1294
01:13:16,542 --> 01:13:17,643
- [Clementine] One, two, three.
- [Joel] You're really gonna die, though.

1295
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:18,934
- [Clementine] Mm-hm.
- [Joel] Okay.

1296
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,244
[Clementine] One, two, three.

1297
01:13:20,417 --> 01:13:22,875
- [Joel] You're dead.
- [both groaning]

1298
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:26,205
[Joel] Oh, my mom. It's... It's okay.
We 're playing.

1299
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:28,059
- [Clementine] Hi, Joel's mom.
- [Joel] It's not real.

1300
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:30,745
- [Clementine] He's killing me.
- [Joel] Okay, are you dead yet?

1301
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:33,454
You're dead!
[grunts]

1302
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:35,115
Uh, I think I got
the hang of this.

1303
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:38,580
I still don't understand it,
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1304
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:55,409
[Joel] Clem! [gasps]

1305
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:59,241
Clem!
[grunting]

1306
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,036
[muffled grunting]

1307
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:05,203
[groans]

1308
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,999
[growling]

1309
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:16,199
Jo... Joely?

1310
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,661
Are you okay, Joel?

1311
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:21,743
- Joel? Joel?
- [laughing]

1312
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:23,783
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.

1313
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,869
- Okay, okay.
- That was like three seconds.

1314
01:14:26,042 --> 01:14:27,802
[Joel] All right.
Let me do it one more time.

1315
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:29,226
One more. One more, then I get to go.

1316
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,250
[Joel] Okay.

1317
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:42,707
- [Joel] Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!
- [Clementine giggling]

1318
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:45,143
- [Joel] Look at this.
- [Clementine] This is so cool!

1319
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:47,124
[Joel] Cool. Look out! Look out!

1320
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:52,248
It's fluff.

1321
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,616
Our house!

1322
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,366
- Come on. Whoo-hoo!
- [Joel] Come on.

1323
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:01,328
Come on. We gotta go!

1324
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:02,577
Whoo!

1325
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,036
Come on!

1326
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,039
We gotta go. Clem?

1327
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:10,619
We gotta go.

1328
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,744
Aah! Come on!

1329
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:16,287
- No!
- This is a really bad time for this!

1330
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,324
Get off me! Oh, God!

1331
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:22,409
- I don't even know where we're going.
- It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1332
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:25,041
- It's the best place. No, this way.
- No, this way.

1333
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:29,702
No, no, no. This way.
You're no help at all. [shouts]

1334
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:32,367
- What's wrong with you?
- No! [laughing]

1335
01:15:32,542 --> 01:15:34,749
Let go of me, Joel!

1336
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:37,624
[grunts]

1337
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:49,282
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1338
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,208
[chuckles]

1339
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:55,574
[grunts]
I guess, uh...

1340
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:58,708
I guess I'll go out
for... for some air,

1341
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:00,456
if nobody minds.

1342
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:03,283
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

1343
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:05,994
Yeah, that's, uh...

1344
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:07,667
that's fine.

1345
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:19,995
- [door closes]
- [Mary] Do you like quotes, Howard?

1346
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:23,417
What do you mean?

1347
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,162
Oh, you know,
like famous quotes?

1348
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,991
I find reading them
inspirational,

1349
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:32,785
and in my reading, I've come across some
I thought you might like too.

1350
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:36,451
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.

1351
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:38,032
[Mary] There's one that goes,

1352
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:41,989
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
the better even of their blunders."

1353
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,707
- [Mierzwiak] That's Nietzsche, right?
- Yeah.

1354
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:46,726
And here I thought I could tell
you something you didn't know.

1355
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:47,750
Oh, no.

1356
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:50,909
It's... It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1357
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:53,916
Yeah. Oh, and there's
this other one I like.

1358
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:56,791
It's by Pope Alexander,
and it goes...

1359
01:16:56,958 --> 01:16:59,450
- [Mierzwiak] Alexander Pope?
- Oh, yeah.

1360
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:00,831
Yeah. Shit.

1361
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:05,289
It's just that I told myself not to say
"Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope,

1362
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,369
and then I go ahead and say it.

1363
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:09,954
- It's no big deal.
- You're such a sweetheart.

1364
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:16,531
The quote goes, "How happy is
the blameless vestal's lot?

1365
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,245
The world forgetting,
by the world forgot.

1366
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:24,333
Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind.

1367
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:29,155
Each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned."

1368
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:33,748
I want to be
a great big, huge elephant...

1369
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:36,453
with a huge trunk like that.

1370
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:40,955
Clem? Clementine?

1371
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:44,038
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1372
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,870
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

1373
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,995
I really admire
the work you do, Howard.

1374
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:58,025
- I don't mean to be so familiar.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

1375
01:17:58,083 --> 01:18:00,370
I-I-I-I-I... I'm happy to hear...

1376
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:07,375
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

1377
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:11,245
[sighing]

1378
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:13,699
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1379
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:19,282
- I shouldn't have said that.
- [Mierzwiak] Oh, Mary, no.

1380
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:22,125
It's... You're a wonderful girl.

1381
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:26,323
But I... You know,
I have a wife and kids.

1382
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,207
You know I have a wife and kids.

1383
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:30,161
Oh, Mary.

1384
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,162
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1385
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:46,333
Oh, whoa.

1386
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,786
Well, good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1387
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:02,328
[honking]

1388
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,101
- [Mary] What?
- [Mierzwiak] Oh, my God!

1389
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,125
[Mary] Who is it?

1390
01:19:07,417 --> 01:19:08,578
[sighs]

1391
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:13,619
Uh...

1392
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:21,457
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1393
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:29,332
- Hollis. Hollis!
- [engine starts]

1394
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:31,289
Hollis!

1395
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:34,286
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.

1396
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:36,708
I knew it, Howard.

1397
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:38,434
Hollis, it didn't start out
to be like this.

1398
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:41,496
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1399
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:44,027
- I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
- [Mierzwiak] Yeah.

1400
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:46,078
I swear I basically
forced him into it!

1401
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:50,207
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1402
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:54,573
Tell me what?

1403
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,740
Oh, you poor kid.

1404
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:01,833
You can have him.
You did.

1405
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,500
What?

1406
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,573
Oh, uh...

1407
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:26,249
We have a history.

1408
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,458
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1409
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:31,706
You...

1410
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,540
You wanted it done...

1411
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:38,288
so you could get past, uh...

1412
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:42,158
You could... Yeah.

1413
01:20:43,917 --> 01:20:48,332
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

1414
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,286
It's almost morning.
We'll...

1415
01:20:52,042 --> 01:20:53,328
We'll talk later.

1416
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,365
Okay?

1417
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:09,032
[Stan]
Hey.

1418
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:15,615
Let me give you a lift home.

1419
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,411
[Clementine] Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1420
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:30,036
- Hi.
- Hi.

1421
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:35,038
Didn't figure you'd show
your face around me again.

1422
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:38,791
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

1423
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:40,824
You did run away, after all.

1424
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:43,040
[Joel] I just needed to see ya.

1425
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:44,917
Yeah?

1426
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:47,664
I'd like to, um,

1427
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:51,036
take you out or something.

1428
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:53,157
You're married.

1429
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,616
Not yet. Not married.

1430
01:21:57,667 --> 01:21:59,374
No, I'm not married, no.

1431
01:21:59,542 --> 01:22:02,455
Look, man, I'm telling you
right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1432
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:06,869
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage

1433
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:09,124
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1434
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:11,249
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1435
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:13,452
Okay.

1436
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:17,580
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1437
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,663
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1438
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:24,280
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's
looking for my own peace of mind.

1439
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:28,372
- Don't assign me yours.
- I remember that speech really well.

1440
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,368
- I had you pegged, didn't I?
- You had the whole human race pegged.

1441
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:34,415
Hmm. Probably.

1442
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:38,912
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1443
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:40,911
even after that.

1444
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:43,620
Mmm. I know.

1445
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:48,703
It would be different...

1446
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:52,199
if we could just give it
another go around.

1447
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:57,698
[Clementine] Remember me.

1448
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:00,661
Try your best.

1449
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:04,873
Maybe we can.

1450
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,242
[Mierzwiak] Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,

1451
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:41,784
and, uh, then we 71
take it from there.

1452
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:42,958
[Mary]
Okay.

1453
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:46,408
I liked you immediately.

1454
01:23:47,292 --> 01:23:49,078
You didn't come on to me at all.

1455
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,036
I liked that.

1456
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:55,416
I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.

1457
01:23:55,958 --> 01:23:57,790
I wanted you to think
I was smart.

1458
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:02,120
I couldn't wait to come to work.

1459
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:05,614
I had these fantasies
of us being married

1460
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:08,705
and having kids and...
just...

1461
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:11,324
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1462
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:14,495
[Mierzwiak] We agreed it's
for the best, Mary.

1463
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:15,953
[Mary crying]
Yeah, I know.

1464
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,119
Oh, God.

1465
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:21,643
- I'll take the bottom and you...
- Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1466
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:22,893
- I can take that.
- So you want me to carry that?

1467
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:24,658
Help me with that. Can you get the cooler?

1468
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,119
Honey, the cooler is...

1469
01:24:26,292 --> 01:24:29,034
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that. Let me get it.

1470
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:30,698
No, no, no, no!

1471
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:32,786
- Don't take anything.
- I can take the plane.

1472
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:35,120
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1473
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,869
[Joel]
This is the day we met.

1474
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:44,163
You were down by the surf. I could just
make you out in the distance.

1475
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:46,495
I remember being drawn to you
even then.

1476
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:50,621
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."

1477
01:24:52,042 --> 01:24:55,489
You were in that orange sweatshirt that
I would come to know so well,

1478
01:24:55,667 --> 01:24:57,658
and even hate, eventually.

1479
01:24:57,833 --> 01:25:01,531
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."

1480
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:03,073
Hi there.

1481
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:06,458
Hi.

1482
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:09,083
I saw you sitting over here...

1483
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:10,743
by yourself,

1484
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:14,575
and I thought, "Thank God.

1485
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:17,590
Someone normal who doesn't know
how to interact at these things either."

1486
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:19,449
Yeah.

1487
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:22,458
I don't ever know what to say.

1488
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,328
I'm Clementine.

1489
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:28,575
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1490
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:30,873
And then you just took it...

1491
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,374
without waiting for an answer.

1492
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:38,414
It was so intimate,

1493
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:41,078
like we were already lovers.

1494
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:44,831
I'm Joel.

1495
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:46,868
Hi, Joel.

1496
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,741
So, no jokes about my name.

1497
01:25:51,417 --> 01:25:52,417
You mean like...

1498
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:55,325
♪ Oh, my darling, oh, my darling,
oh, my darling Clementine ♪

1499
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,582
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1500
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:00,244
Yeah. Like that.

1501
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:02,203
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1502
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:05,996
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1503
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:07,578
[Clementine] Oh.

1504
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,824
I think your name is magical.

1505
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:16,748
This is it, Joel.

1506
01:26:17,792 --> 01:26:19,248
It's gonna be gone soon.

1507
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,240
I know.

1508
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:25,740
What do we do?

1509
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,157
Enjoy it.

1510
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:50,204
- [Clementine] You married?
- [Joel] No.

1511
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:52,215
[Clementine] Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1512
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,825
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1513
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,707
- Male or female?
- What?

1514
01:26:58,417 --> 01:27:00,704
Female. Female.

1515
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:05,492
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1516
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:13,115
- [Joel] You know these people?
- No, of course not. Come on.

1517
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:16,309
[Joel] They might have a dog.

1518
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,165
[Clementine giggling]
There's no dog.

1519
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,161
[Joel] What are you doing?

1520
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:25,205
- It's freezing out.
- I can't believe this.

1521
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,208
Hoo-hoo!

1522
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:32,035
- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!

1523
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:40,995
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1524
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:44,620
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1525
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:48,869
[Joel] It's dark.

1526
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:53,535
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1527
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:56,874
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...

1528
01:27:57,042 --> 01:27:59,409
- You know, we're...
- [laughing] Whatever.

1529
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:03,406
So this is great. Now I can look for,
um, candles, matches,

1530
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:05,915
and the liquor cabinet.

1531
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:07,665
[Joel]
Oh, God.

1532
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,698
[tapping phone receiver button]

1533
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:15,698
I think we should go.

1534
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:18,367
There's no phone line.
What?

1535
01:28:18,542 --> 01:28:20,374
- I think we should go.
- [Clementine] Why?

1536
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:22,124
- It's our house...
- [sighs]

1537
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:23,292
just for tonight.

1538
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:26,325
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1539
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:29,912
- Which one do you want to be?
Uh...

1540
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:32,950
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1541
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,707
- [Joel] What are you do...
- [chuckling]

1542
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:40,824
- Alcohol!
- [Joel] Oh, boy.

1543
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,832
So, are you okay with wine?

1544
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,992
- I don't know.
- Well, you choose the wine.

1545
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:50,115
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

1546
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,333
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
- [Joel] We really should go.

1547
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,787
- [wind howling]
- I've gotta catch my ride.

1548
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:06,530
- [Clementine] So go.
- I did.

1549
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:09,619
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1550
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:12,240
but you were exciting.

1551
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:16,741
[Clementine]
I wish you'd stayed.

1552
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:19,454
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1553
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:21,161
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1554
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:24,825
Oh, God, I wish I had...

1555
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,118
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1556
01:29:32,292 --> 01:29:34,692
[Clementine] Well, I came back downstairs,
and you were gone.

1557
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,240
I walked out.
I walked out the door.

1558
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:38,309
- [Clementine] Why?
- I don't know.

1559
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:39,744
I felt like a scared little kid.

1560
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:42,909
I was like... It was above my head.
I don't know.

1561
01:29:43,542 --> 01:29:44,873
[Clementine] You were scared?

1562
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:46,453
Yeah.

1563
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:49,657
Thought you knew that about me.

1564
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:54,781
[Joel] I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1565
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:58,284
- [Clementine] Was it something I said?
- Yeah.

1566
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:03,036
You said, "So go"...

1567
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:06,117
with such disdain, you know?

1568
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:08,829
- [Clementine] Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1569
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,332
[Clementine] Joely?

1570
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:19,116
What if you stayed this time?

1571
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,616
I walked out the door.

1572
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,574
There's no memory left.

1573
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,741
Come back and make up
a good-bye, at least.

1574
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,619
Let's pretend we had one.

1575
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:43,910
Bye, Joel.

1576
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:46,994
[Joel]
I love you.

1577
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:50,826
[Clementine whispering]
Meet me in Montauk.

1578
01:30:55,708 --> 01:30:58,166
[Rob] I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.

1579
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,789
I didn't crash the plane.

1580
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:02,620
[Carrie] You were operating
the plane with the remote control,

1581
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:03,792
and then it crashed.

1582
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,199
[Rob] It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.

1583
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:08,332
[Carrie] You're stoned,
and you're driving.

1584
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,992
[Rob] The pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.

1585
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:13,967
That's why I smoke it. If I'm going
to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.

1586
01:31:14,542 --> 01:31:17,125
It does.
That's a medical fact.

1587
01:31:17,292 --> 01:31:19,750
It was proven
on the Science Network.

1588
01:31:19,917 --> 01:31:23,035
- [Carrie] Honey, just watch the road.
- [Rob] I can't see shit.

1589
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:27,625
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

1590
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:30,454
- [Joel] She was nice.
- [Rob] Yeah, man. Who was that?

1591
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:35,996
She was, um, just a girl.

1592
01:31:36,167 --> 01:31:40,957
[Carrie and Rob talking indistinctly]

1593
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:42,373
[beeps]

1594
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,500
[Mierzwiak] Okay.

1595
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,491
[Mierzwiak groans]

1596
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:11,290
[line ringing]

1597
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:15,415
[ringing continues]

1598
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,409
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.

1599
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:26,119
[Mierzwiak] Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1600
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:30,246
- We'll talk.
- [horn honks]

1601
01:32:36,917 --> 01:32:40,114
[van door closes, engine starts]

1602
01:33:01,292 --> 01:33:03,454
[groans, sighs]

1603
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,116
[sighs]

1604
01:33:47,958 --> 01:33:49,323
[Stan] Hey!

1605
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,911
Hey.

1606
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:56,893
- You got all your stuff, I see.
- Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1607
01:33:56,917 --> 01:33:58,237
I take it you're not coming back.

1608
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:01,226
You know, I wouldn't come back
if I was you either.

1609
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,412
- Do you swear you didn't know?
- I-I swear.

1610
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:07,791
- So you didn't do the erasing?
- Of course not. God, no.

1611
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:10,199
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1612
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:12,949
[sighs, clears throat]
Once, maybe.

1613
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:17,871
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

1614
01:34:18,042 --> 01:34:20,454
And I saw
you two talking, and I...

1615
01:34:20,958 --> 01:34:23,370
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, and it...

1616
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:25,494
How'd I look?

1617
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:29,456
You looked happy.

1618
01:34:30,167 --> 01:34:32,499
Happy with a secret.

1619
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:35,244
And after that?

1620
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:39,035
I just... I never saw you two together
again like that, so I just...

1621
01:34:39,208 --> 01:34:41,575
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

1622
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,037
[man on PA] Montauk train now
boarding on Track "B."

1623
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:56,281
Next stop, Mastic-Shirley,
Speonk, Westhampton,

1624
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:58,825
Hampton Bays, Southhampton,
Bridgehampton, East Hampton,

1625
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,957
Amagansett and Montauk.

1626
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:04,447
Montauk train now boarding
on Track "B." All aboard.

1627
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:09,832
[Stan] I really like you,
Mary Svevo.

1628
01:35:11,042 --> 01:35:12,407
You know that?

1629
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:24,539
[Mary] Thanks.

1630
01:35:59,792 --> 01:36:00,907
Let me get my toothbrush.

1631
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:02,494
Yeah. Just...

1632
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,286
[beeps]

1633
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:19,041
[Patrick on answering machine]
Where are you, Clem? I'm worried.

1634
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:21,018
- La-Ia-Ia-Ia-Ia.
- [Patrick] I feel like you're mad at me,

1635
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:22,783
and I don't know what I did.

1636
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,740
What did I do?

1637
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,706
I love you so much.

1638
01:36:28,417 --> 01:36:30,124
I'll do anything
to make you happy.

1639
01:36:30,792 --> 01:36:32,703
Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

1640
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:36,788
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.

1641
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,740
Oh. Whew.

1642
01:36:50,542 --> 01:36:52,909
- [Clementine] Vámonos, señor.
- [Joel chuckles]

1643
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:55,992
I-I had a really nice time
last night.

1644
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:58,365
Nice?

1645
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:02,030
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life

1646
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,494
last night.

1647
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:05,533
That's better.

1648
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,500
This is weird.

1649
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:13,075
[Mary] To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

1650
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:14,327
My name is Mary Svevo.

1651
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,491
"We've met,
but you don't remember me.

1652
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:19,270
[voices overlapping] I worked for
a company you hired to have...

1653
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,165
part of your memory erased."

1654
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,934
[Mary] [have since decided
that this is a horrible...

1655
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:24,351
Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1656
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:27,913
[Mary] In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.

1657
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:32,040
[on tape] My name is
Clementine Kruczynski.

1658
01:37:32,625 --> 01:37:35,242
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1659
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,658
- What is this?
- [Clementine] I don't know.

1660
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:42,407
[Clementine] He's boring. Is that enough
reason to erase someone?

1661
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:45,120
I've been thinking lately
how I was before and howl am now,

1662
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:46,623
and it's like he changed me.

1663
01:37:46,792 --> 01:37:50,035
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.

1664
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:53,655
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.

1665
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,662
That pathetic, wimpy,
apologetic smile.

1666
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,824
That sort of wounded puppy
shit he does, you know?

1667
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
What are you doing?

1668
01:38:00,042 --> 01:38:01,042
I'm not doing anything.

1669
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,726
[on tape] The bloom is certainly fucking
off the rose at this point.

1670
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:05,037
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

1671
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:07,950
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!

1672
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:09,957
- You clearly are.
- Look, okay.

1673
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:12,287
Let's just... just take a minute and...

1674
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,286
[Clementine sighs]

1675
01:38:30,708 --> 01:38:31,869
[door closes]

1676
01:38:33,042 --> 01:38:35,249
[panting]

1677
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:42,869
Patrick, get the fuck away.

1678
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:44,922
- Oh, sweetheart...
- Get the fuck away from me!

1679
01:38:45,542 --> 01:38:48,342
- [Patrick] Can we talk about it?
- [Clementine] No! Get the fuck away!

1680
01:38:48,792 --> 01:38:50,533
[sobbing]

1681
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,536
[brake clicks]

1682
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:22,073
Joel Barish

1683
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:25,870
- [Frank] Hey, Clementine.
- Hey.

1684
01:39:26,042 --> 01:39:28,955
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1685
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:31,869
Yeah.

1686
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:34,286
[Joel on tape]
really very educated.

1687
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:37,780
I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.

1688
01:39:38,292 --> 01:39:40,750
I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?

1689
01:39:40,917 --> 01:39:42,999
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

1690
01:39:44,417 --> 01:39:46,784
Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.

1691
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:50,370
Sometimes I was
embarrassed in public...

1692
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:52,542
- [Clementine] Hi.
- Because she would pronounce

1693
01:39:52,625 --> 01:39:54,662
- library "library."
- [Joel] Hi.

1694
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:57,616
[on tape] Libary. Libary.

1695
01:39:59,542 --> 01:40:00,577
Look what I found.

1696
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:04,322
[Joel on tape] 1 think if there's a truly
seductive quality about Clementine,

1697
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,447
it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.

1698
01:40:10,042 --> 01:40:12,329
You made me look skinny.

1699
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,241
[Joel on tape]
Amazing, burning meteorite

1700
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:18,456
that'll carry you to another world,
a world where things are exciting.

1701
01:40:19,583 --> 01:40:22,371
But what you quickly learn
is that

1702
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:25,291
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1703
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:27,244
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1704
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:30,476
- It's okay.
- [Joel on tape] ...flashy

1705
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,582
in a kind of obvious way.

1706
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:35,992
- But still, it seduces you.
- Joel, I really like you.

1707
01:40:36,167 --> 01:40:38,408
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1708
01:40:38,583 --> 01:40:42,702
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.

1709
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:46,119
[Joel on tape]
Where's the real Clementine?

1710
01:40:46,292 --> 01:40:49,364
I mean, the whole thing
with the hair... it's all bullshit.

1711
01:40:49,875 --> 01:40:51,866
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1712
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:54,050
- [Joel] I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1713
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:55,923
- I do.
- [on tape] The world's a goddamn mess.

1714
01:40:55,958 --> 01:40:58,199
This is how you rebel?
Change your hair color?

1715
01:40:58,375 --> 01:41:00,082
You want a drink or something?

1716
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:01,581
Do you have any whiskey?

1717
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,325
[Joel on tape] No, [don't think her sex
is... motivated.

1718
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:11,534
I saw it clearly the last night
we were together.

1719
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:14,871
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.

1720
01:41:15,042 --> 01:41:18,080
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1721
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:19,915
[Joel on tape] The only way Clem thinks

1722
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:23,121
she can get people
to like her is to fuck 'em...

1723
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:28,118
or at least dangle the possibility of
getting fucked in front of 'em.

1724
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:32,075
And she's so desperate
and insecure

1725
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:36,289
that she'll, sooner or later,
go around and fuck everybody.

1726
01:41:36,667 --> 01:41:40,035
- I don't do that.
- [Joel] I wouldn't think that about you.

1727
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:42,119
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1728
01:41:43,167 --> 01:41:45,809
Because it really hurts me that you said
that because I don't do that.

1729
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:47,434
- [Joel] I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry about all this.

1730
01:41:47,458 --> 01:41:49,540
I'm gonna... go.

1731
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:53,952
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

1732
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:01,992
Um... bye.

1733
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:04,825
- Bye.
- [on tape] I thought I knew her so well.

1734
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,560
- It was nice meeting you and all.
- But I don't know her at all.

1735
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:13,072
What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,

1736
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,958
only to find out
that she's a stranger.

1737
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:21,948
Wait.

1738
01:42:24,417 --> 01:42:25,953
- What?
- I don't know.

1739
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:28,309
- Just wait. Just wait.
- [Clementine] What do you want, Joel?

1740
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:31,780
I don't know.
I want you to wait for... just a while.

1741
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:43,912
[sobs]

1742
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:48,158
- Okay.
- Really?

1743
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:50,285
I'm not a concept, Joel.

1744
01:42:50,458 --> 01:42:53,371
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking
for my own peace of mind.

1745
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,533
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything

1746
01:42:55,708 --> 01:42:57,164
that I don't like about you.

1747
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:59,449
- But you will. But you will.
- Right now I can't.

1748
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,664
You know, you will think of things, and
I'll get bored with you and feel trapped

1749
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:05,619
because that's
what happens with me.

1750
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:09,039
Okay.

1751
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:14,292
[Clementine] Okay.

1752
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:18,833
[crying]

1753
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,991
- Okay.
- [Joel] Okay.

1754
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:24,666
